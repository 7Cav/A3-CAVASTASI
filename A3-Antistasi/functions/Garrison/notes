[DONE] A new, easy to get, definition of how units are saved on marker
[DONE] A new system to determine which outpost needs reinforcements the most
[DONE] A new system how reinforcements are choosen (A dead MG gunner will be replaced by another MG guy)

[DONE] An implementation to work within the current system for debug purposes
[DONE] A new cyclic spawn system
[DONE] A simple cleanup so it does not fill the data with junk
[DONE] Integration with the current system

AI Ideas
================================================================================

Asymmetric style

AI character : Balanced, Increase, Influence (default NATO), Progress (default CSAT) or Random

Funding
- Balanced : Gets the same amount of funds every tick, no increase or decrease possible
- Increase : Funding raises with the war level
- Influence : Funding is bound to the amount of sites under faction control
- Progress : Low basic income, bonus every time the faction captures something
- Random : Random amount every tick

Target selection
- Balanced : Each site and mission has the same priority
- Increase : Like balanced
- Influence : Targets sites with high income first, support missions high priority, military missions low priority
- Progress : Targets weakest or most important sites first, support missions low priority, military missions low priority
- Random : Target selection is random, mission priority is random

Aggro behavior
- Balanced : Aggro is balanced through all parts
- Increase : Aggro will slightly increase over the game, behavior as balanced
- Influence : Aggro by civilian parts is increased, aggro by military parts is decreased
- Progress : Aggro by civilian parts is disabled, aggro by military parts is highly increased
- Random : Aggro is randomly done

AI fighting : Balanced (default NATO), Aggressive (default CSAT), Defensive, Tactical, Random

Unit compositions
- Balanced : Units compositions will contain air and land vehicles as well as various groups
- Aggressive : Armored vehicles and heavy helicopters, no unarmed vehicles
- Defensive : Mostly APCs, high chance for AA and drones
- Tactical : Unit composition based on target, high chance for sniper, mortar or explosives teams
- Random : Purely random compositions

Attack frequency
- Balanced : One attack every 10 to 30 minutes
- Aggressive : Will attack every time it has enough units to form a attack force
- Defensive : Tend to no attacks at all, one in an hour
- Tactical : Multiple attacks on several sites in an AO at the same time, then longer pause
- Random : Attacks are randomly scheduled

Fighting style attack
- Balanced : Standard attack without any special attributes
- Aggressive : Attacks with airstrikes, mortar and heavy weapons, will destroy houses and kill civilians on their way
- Defensive : Standard attack, will approach silently (not by airdropping from a helicopter)
- Tactical : Will harass units as long as possible, will only go in if site is nearly cleared
- Random : Attacks will follow no rules

Fighting style defense
- Balanced : Standard defense script
- Aggressive : Will engage with everything available on the site, will instantly call for support
- Defensive : Will fortify the positions with AA, AT and mortar, will try to keep attack away instead of killing them
- Tactical : Will flank the attacker from multiple position and lay out mines
- Random : Defender will follow random procedures
